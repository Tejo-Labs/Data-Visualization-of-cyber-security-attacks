# README: Cybersecurity Policy - Data Management and Visualization for Cyber Attacks

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing cyberattacks using basic data management techniques and visualization tools in R. It introduces datasets, RMarkdown for documentation, and tools like `ggplot` for visual analysis of trends in cyberattacks.

## Objectives
1. Explore the sources and targets of cyberattacks through data manipulation.
2. Visualize attack patterns and trends using Sankey diagrams and line plots.
3. Analyze the frequency and success of various attack methods and their impact on different types of targets.
4. Gain hands-on experience in R programming, data management, and visualization techniques.

## Key Components
1. **Data Sources**:
   - `cyberattacks-across-the-globe-cases.csv`
   - `cyberattacks-by-year.csv`
   - `cyberattacks-by-year-and-method.csv`
   - `cyberattacks-by-attack_on.csv`

2. **Tasks**:
   - Data exploration and manipulation using functions like `unique()`, `table()`, and `sort()`.
   - Visualization with `ggplot` for trends and `alluvial` for Sankey diagrams.

3. **Key Analysis Questions**:
   - What are the most common sources and targets of cyberattacks?
   - How do the success rates of attacks vary across different methods and targets?
   - What trends are observed in the frequency and methods of cyberattacks over time?

## Steps to Complete
1. **Setup**:
   - Install necessary R packages (`pacman`, `data.table`, `ggplot2`, `alluvial`).
   - Load the datasets into R memory using `fread()`.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explore data objects and structure using functions like `names()`, `glimpse()`, and `table()`.
   - Generate vectors for top sources and targets based on attack frequency.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Create Sankey diagrams to visualize source-target relationships.
   - Use `ggplot` to explore trends in attack frequency and methods.

4. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Investigate year-wise trends in attacks.
   - Analyze attack success rates by target types and methods.

5. **Final Visualization**:
   - Create a comprehensive plot of year-trends for attacks on government and private entities, excluding military targets.

## Deliverables
- **RMarkdown File**: A report containing all solutions, analysis, and visualizations.
- **HTML Report**: Compiled from the RMarkdown file using the `knit` function.

## Tools and Packages
- **RMarkdown**: For documentation and report generation.
- **Data.table**: Efficient data management.
- **ggplot2**: For creating detailed and aesthetic visualizations.
- **Alluvial**: For generating Sankey diagrams.

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with R programming for data manipulation and visualization.
- Deeper understanding of global cyberattack patterns and their implications.
- Skills in presenting analytical findings through interactive and visual reports.

## Notes
- Follow best practices for RMarkdown, such as renaming files appropriately and structuring chunks logically.
- Ensure the accuracy of all visualizations and analysis before compiling the final report.
